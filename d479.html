            <h1 class="underline text-lg font-medium">Let's make another website!</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This class was a bit frustrating for me, the reviewers sending back my evaluation stating certain criteria of the assignment isn't present. This could be my fault for not making it clear enough even though I thought I had... Don't make the same mistake as me. <strong>BE VERY CLEAR when completing the assignments objectives.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <h1>Task 1:</h1>
            <ol>
                <li class="list-decimal mb-2"><p></li>Part A. Your first step is to create a timeline of the UX design that will take place during the project. I itemized by week > day > activity. I.E Week 1: Monday - Tuesday (Task, task, task) You don't have to actually follow your timeline, you are just creating a mock one.</p></li>
                <li class="list-decimal mb-2"><p>Part B. You will create a "Persona profile" This is just a mock person that you are creating the website for. The information for the person is in the "About the island" document. Look up a couple examples of a persona profile to get an idea of what you need to do. It just needs to contain the information they give you, very simple.</p></li>
                <li class="list-decimal mb-2"><p>Part C. Create a wireframe showing the suggested flow of your website. At this point we have done lots of these. I created two, one for my home page and one for what the rest of the pages will look like. I used canva, you should use figma.</p></li>
                <li class="list-decimal mb-2"><p>Part D. Conduct guerrilla testing. This is a super annoying task. You are supposed to get three people to look at your wireframe and essentially give their thoughts on it. the second part of this task is to summarize, specify if it is actionable or not and explain how you will incorporate this feedback to improve your wireframe. A suggestion is actionable if you can make the physical changes to the design. (Don't try to find three people to look at your wireframe just make up some problems with it and fix it)</p></li>
                <li class="list-decimal"><p>Part E. Create a interactive prototype. You can do this many different ways... Powerpoint, figma, or html/css. I went the html/css route to develop my webdev skills more. Make sure you incorporate the feedback you received from part D as well.</p></li>
                <li class="list-decimal"><p>Part F. List five objective usability tasks you want users to test in Task 2. Make up 5 things for other people to check and make sure it works on your website because in Task 2 you will be having other students test out the site you created. (Please don't make it a scavenger hunt for information, way to many people did that and it was annoying. Your 5 usability tasks should be functionality focused)</p></li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1>Task 2:</h1>
            <p>There isn't too much to say about task 2. You will be reviewing some of your peers work in a video checking their 5 usability tasks and then you will also document their feedback on your site. This is where I hope you don't run into some students wanting to send you on a scavenger hunt for information. There is really no need to do this. My 5 usability tasks were all functionality based and I had no issues.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="mt-2">Submit it and be on your way. Like I said at the start be <strong>VERY</strong> clear when answering task related questions or you will certainly be kicked back.</p>
